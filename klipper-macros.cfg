# X position to park toolhead (set "max" or "min" to infer from stepper config).
variable_park_x: 70.0

variable_park_y: 10.0
variable_start_end_park_y: 260.0 # Defaults to print_max Y. Was 290
#sensorless custom end

#(default: True) - If True the extruder is set to its target temperature before 
#bed leveling begins. If False the target is set after bed level completes. 
#Setting True warms up the extruder faster and False prevents oozing during 
#bed level. The extruder preheat is applied independent of this setting.

# If non-zero the extruder will stabilize at this temp before probing the bed.

#This value is multiplied by the target extruder temperature and the result is 
#used as the preheat value for the extruder while the bed is heating to prevent ooze
